Hi, I'm Xiaoyuan, a 4th-year undergrad at [USC](https://www.usc.edu/)<img src="/assets/img/usc.svg" alt="USC logo" style="height:1.3em; vertical-align:-0.2em; margin-left:0.25em;" /> , double majoring in computer science and applied math. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Willie Neiswanger](https://willieneis.github.io/), [Prof. Robin Jia](https://robinjia.github.io/), and [Prof. Xuezhe Ma](https://xuezhemax.github.io/). I had wonderful time interning at [USC Interaction Lab](https://uscinteractionlab.web.app/)<img src="/assets/img/interaction_lab.png" alt="Interaction Lab logo" style="height:1.1em; vertical-align:-0.2em; margin-left:0.25em;" /> (summer 2023), [CAIS](https://safe.ai/)<img src="/assets/img/cais_logo.png" alt="CAIS logo" style="height:1.2em; vertical-align:-0.2em; margin-left:0.25em;" /> (winter 2023), and with [Prof. Steven Wu](https://zstevenwu.com/) at [CMU S3D](https://s3d.cmu.edu/)<img src="/assets/img/cmu_red_simple.png" alt="CMU logo" style="height:1.1em; vertical-align:-0.15em; margin-left:0.25em;" /> (summer 2025) .

My research mainly focuses on developing **efficient and effective** training-time and inference-time methods to improve model safety and usability . Some broad questions I'm recently interested in :

- can we identify what can be learned from user feedback, and how to enable models to learn continuously after deployment ?

- How to improve the sampling and computational efficiency of rollouts in RL, especially in settings with sparser reward ?

Alongside my research, I co-lead [USC's AI Safety Club](https://aisafetyusc.notion.site/About-Us-026a440a9c204050b0160121aab8a88a), a student group promoting safety in advanced AI systems. We run semester-long programs on [introductory](https://aisafetyusc.notion.site/Intro-Track-da1b7bbf96db436ba365dbd41f8db686) and [technical](https://aisafetyusc.notion.site/Advanced-Track-b331dfaa45a44eae82852ed1b2dc9303) topics . I‚Äôve also explored [computational neuroscience üß†](assets/pdf/CNTC_2024_Poster.pdf) .


**I‚Äôm applying to Ph.D. programs for Fall 2026 ! ‚ú®**
